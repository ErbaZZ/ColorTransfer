# Image Color Transfer with opencv (Course project for ITCS381 - Introduction to Multimedia Systems)
This project uses Color Transfer technique to transfer the color from source image to target image, making
target image has similar look and feel to source image.
## Implementation
Using the skeleton code template provided by the instructor. I had to implement the following parts:
1. Calculation of average and standard deviation for both source and target images.
2. Calculation of the value in each pixel of the new image.
3. Clipping the value in each pixel of the new image.
